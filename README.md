# Explore http-framework
 REST APIs using the node HTTP module

## Installation

 ```bash
 $ npm install explore-401
 ```

## Usage

Here is the example of url post

```js
const app = require('explore-401');

app.router.post('/post', app.postRequest);

app.server(app.router.route()).listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('server up');
});
```
Here you can use `superagent localhost:4000/post post '{"hello":"world"}'` and post any data with json type you want.

Here is the example of url get

```js
const app = require('explore-401');

app.router.get('/get', app.res.buildResponse({note:'hello'}));

app.server(app.router.route()).listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('server up');
});
```
In `app.res.buildResponse()`, you could pass data with string, object or html type into `app.res.buildResponse()`.

## Build Response
The buildResponse function simplifies the response object from the server and detects the content type of the data passed in.

## POST Request
Handles the post request using superagent-cli.
